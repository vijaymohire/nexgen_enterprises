Using Technology to design domain solutions unlike state of the art technology, how , apply AR and deep domain expertise to harness the AR based technique to leverage technical features to design domain solutions in resolving prevailing issues in that domain that can disrupt market,generate value and drive economy.

Structure the business units based on domains and base them with various Technology base models that will be extend to meet domain requirements and fine tune.

Have a Cmdb with all these domains and technology base focused on QAI under various capacities from mobile based computing ,laptop, edge, server and Supercomputer. Start with Excel sheet and move that to a Cmdb. 

Once domain needs and technology base is identified, solutions to domain needs are developed. 

Also add state of art issues related to domains, projects, real world issues, and these needs are to be addressed by unique technology and scientific solutions.

Use a simple Gui to interface these db with gui for admin and use as Master DB and Admin.

Solution Cafe is good for getting services related to your products or leverages on existing products.

However, you need to build these domain products that solve problems or improves on the state of the art. 

Products can be any IT assets, models, tangible products that can be handed to client for operations in their domain.

Delivery of models, Ent Arch doesn't add value. You need to address unique domain and user issues and design products that will become part of a solution that can package partner, 3 party assets, plugins, etc with a major asset by me.

So QA, TRL, PM are mere tools to reach the goal. GitHub code, Embedded code, Apps, Web pages, New Server design, parts, tools etc are to be developed
